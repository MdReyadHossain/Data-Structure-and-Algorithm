## Getting Started

> First of all you need to install letest version of python on your machine, <br>Then follow these instruction:

1. To run clone repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MdReyadHossainData-Structure-and-Algorithm.git
```

2. Change directory:

```bash
cd Data-Structure-and-Algorithm
```

3. run any 'main.py' file from any directory:
    > python -u directory name/main.py <br>for example:

```bash
python -u Linked_List/main.py
```
